Here, we studied the polymorphism of SrCl 2 ammines with a general formula of Sr(NH 3 ) n Cl 2 (n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) by combining the Fast and Flexible CrystAl Structure Predictor (FFCASP) with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the lattice stability and the minimum energy paths for bulk and surface diffusion of NH 3 were investigated by performing phonon and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations. In addition to the successful reproduction of the reported experimental crystal structures of octammine (Pnma (IT number 62)), diammine (Aem2 (IT number 39)) and monoammine (Cmcm (IT number 63)), several isoenergetic polymorphs for each phase were also found. Not only the experimentally determined octammine and monoammine structures, but also the proposed structures for the hexammine and tetrammine phases were found to be metastable. While phonon calculations show unstability for the experimental diammine structure, some of the proposed structures for the diammine phase showed thermodynamical stability. Moreover, NEB paths examining the bulk and surface diffusion of NH3 are in accordance with the experimental desorption enthalpies.","tags":["Crystal Structure Prediction","Discovery of Energy Materials","Ammonia Storage Materials"],"title":"Stable and metastable crystal structures and ammonia dynamics in strontium chloride ammines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gozde Inis Demir","Samet Demir","Adem Tekin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661558400,"objectID":"432773bcf9acc8eaa0d6a5c49560db61","permalink":"https://gzdgrffn.github.io/publication/2dffcasp/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2dffcasp/","section":"publication","summary":"Biomolecular self-assembly on surfaces is an emerging and exciting field for the fabrication of 2D nanostructures that are being used in a wide range of applications. Self-assembly of the nucleic acid bases, which are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonding, in both solution and solid have been well characterized by various experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Especially for the surface based self assemblies, the resolution of STM images is quite insufficient to reveal the dominating intermolecular interactions which lead to the formation of self-assembled DNA bases. Moreover, it is also possible to form crystalline order self assemblies by finding suitable experimental conditions. This fact allows the application of crystal structure prediction (CSP) tools for the discovery of ordered self assemblies. In this regard, the existing CSP method called FFCASP has been extended with a new implementation allowing the prediction of 1D or 2D periodic and nonperiodic structures. The new approach, 2D-FFCASP, has been applied to four DNA bases and the best resulting structures have been further evaluated by dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) and cluster in a molecule local correlation approach at the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (CIM-RI-MP2). 2D-FFCASP successfully reproduced the known self-assemblies of DNA bases in addition to many newly found isoenergetic structures.","tags":["2D Structure Prediction","2D Structures of DNA"],"title":"2D-FFCASP—A New Approach for 2D Structure Prediction Applied to Self-Assemblies of DNA Bases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gozde Inis Demir","Riccarda Caputo","Samet Demir","Adem Tekin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620345600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620345600,"objectID":"173c40b760e221d12485cb793ea86be1","permalink":"https://gzdgrffn.github.io/publication/b3n2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/b3n2/","section":"publication","summary":"Dual-cation ammine metal borohydrides are favorable hydrogen storage materials due to their high gravimetric density and relatively low hydrogen release temperature. By combining the Fast and Flexible CrystAl Structure Predictor with density functional theory calculations and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, we studied the polymorphism, the lattice stability, and the decomposition mechanism of LiMg(BH4)3(NH3)2 in the temperature range 100–700 K. The onset of H2(g) formation is found at 400 K through the recombination of the hydrogen atoms from the bond cleavage of B–H and N–H in BH4 and NH3 groups. In addition to two hexagonal structures, of which one is the global minimum structure (P63/m)) and the other corresponds to the experimentally proposed room-temperature structure (P63), a monoclinic (Cc) structure and two orthorhombic structures (Fmm2, Ima2) are proposed as stable structures.","tags":["Crystal Structure Prediction","Discovery of Energy Materials","Dehydrogenation Mechanism"],"title":"Crystal Structure Prediction and Dehydrogenation Mechanism of LiMg(BH4)3(NH3)2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gozde Inis Demir"],"categories":[],"content":"There were three categories in the second Computhon; • Single-node: Parallel computation on multi-core CPUs.\n• Single-node: Parallel computation on multiple GPUs.\n• Multi-node: Distributed computing on multiple nodes + CPUs and GPUs\nOur team of three (me, Ahmet Tuncer Durak and Samet Demir) won the competition in all categories.\nIt was a great week that we worked together and enjoyed every minute of it.\nDetails about the Computhon 2022/1 can be found from the event website.\nTweet of EuroCC@Turkey that they announced the winners.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"6e929dc84ed3ef80467b02e64cd2ed64","permalink":"https://gzdgrffn.github.io/post/jupyter/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/jupyter/","section":"post","summary":"Our team won all three prizes of the EuroCC HPC hackhaton","tags":[],"title":"EuroCC@Turkey Computhon 2022/1","type":"post"}]
